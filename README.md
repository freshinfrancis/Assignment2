Distributed Systems Assignment 2
- Creating a Weather App using Maven

- Started the assignment by creating basic weather app with default input values in content server and updated that data in the aggregation server and then initiated GET request from Client. All this helped to understand how the GET and PUT Request works as well as how the client and server communicate using Sockets.

- In the next step, tried to upload data from the default json file from content server to aggregation server.
